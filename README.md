# Get-HypervisorHosts ðŸ’»
<b> Detects if host(s) are running common Hypervisors (e.g. Hyper-V, VMware, VirtualBox, WSL etc.) to assist hunt for attackers carrying out tasks from VM without logging, AV or EDR monitoring.</b><br>
Looks for Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware Workstation/Player (basic ESXi signals if accessible), VirtualBox, QEMU/KVM (via process signatures), WSL Hyper-V Platform. By default queries localhost. Requires WinRM (port 5985) for remote host(s) query.<br>

<b>As a Red Teamer,</b> one of the techniques used quite often on an organization's Pwn3d box would be to introduce a VM with required tools pre-loaded, to avoid dealing with AV/EDR/Logging etc. this is a common practice (By the way, that's one reason why you might see alerts with names such as 'WIN-D2B1E23QVBC'). Yet what sparked this simple script was this <b><a title="X tweet by fellow colleague Stephan Berger" href="https://x.com/malmoeb/status/1937493450573684743?t=cysH2XBtdSoiZU3ZOWY32A&s=03" target="_blank">X tweet by fellow colleague Stephan Berger</a></b>. I thought it would be beneficial to have such a powershell script handy. of course, not replacing proper hunting platforms and tools that you may have in place, just as is. It uses several indicators, such as files, services etc.<br>
<b>Note:</b> can use this script to evaluate anomalies such as detecting a hypervisor vendor that is not/should not be used in your environment, or, if VMs are installed and running on host that should not be hosting VMs (e.g. Laptop belonging to HR employee, basically Non-Dev/IT/Research etc.)<br>

The parameter <b>ComputerName</b> defaults to local host. Any number of remote hosts can be queried using WinRM/PSremoting (usual especially in Active Directory domains).<br><br>
The optional parameter <b>CsvOutputPath</b> cab be speficied to export results to a CSV file.<br><br>
The optional parameter <b>GetLoggedOnUser</b> also gets the currently interactively logged-on user(s).<br>
### Example: Get indicators from local host
Import the module/function, and then run it straight forward without any parameters to get locally installed Hypervisors (screenshot from v1.0):<br>
```
Import-Module .\Get-HypervisorHosts.ps1;
Get-HypervisorHosts
```

### Example: Hunt for hosts running hypervisors in the AD domain
Import the module/function, get computer names (from list, file, directly from AD, etc.) and run the query against multiple hosts, with Verbose enabled (to get query status in real-time). Also get logged on user (optional parameter). Results exported to a CSV file when done:<br>
```
Import-Module .\Get-HypervisorHosts.ps1;
$Date = (Get-Date).AddDays(-30); $c = Get-ADComputer -Filter {Enabled -eq $true -and LastLogonDate -ge $Date} -Properties LastLogonDate | Select -ExpandProperty Name;
Get-HypervisorHosts -ComputerName $c -CsvOutputPath c:\temp\hypervisorHostsInfo.csv -Verbose -GetLoggedOnUser
```

### Show exported CSV results into a grid
Import the csv file created by Get-HypervisorHost, and show it in a grid:<br>
```
Import-Csv C:\Temp\hypervisorHostInfo.csv | Out-GridView
```
